## Core Features

The following image shows the first 4 features added to Joomla's core.

### Google SERP Preview
[Link to PR](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc22_seo/pull/7)<br><br>
This new feature gives Joomla content creators an idea of how their article will appear to the end users on search engines. It becomes extremely important for the content creator to customize this piece of information as there is limited space available.<br>
It can also be thought of as a small advertisement for the Joomla user’s content to attract potential leads.

### Content Analysis
[Link to PR](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc22_seo/pull/7)<br><br>
This feature is related to the previous feature (SERP Preview). It highlights the aspects of the article that need improvement and also provides suggestions for refinement. Some of these parameters include the article title, meta description, and article word count. Fixing these can boost the article’s click rate significantly.

### Page Performance
[Link to PR](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc22_seo/pull/4)<br><br>
A simple way to measure the page’s core web vitals with a single click. It provides insights on the page’s loading speed and ratings for the article based on multiple criteria while also providing suggestions to fix the issues.

### Outgoing Dofollow-Nofollow Link Checker
[Link to PR](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc22_seo/pull/3)<br><br>
This allows the admin to monitor the external links of the article and categorize them as dofollow and nofollow. It will enable developers to prevent ‘link juice’ from flowing out to unwanted sites based on the external site's credibility. Admins can choose to retain or change the ‘rel’ directive (from dofollow to nofollow or vice versa) by going to the 'Content' tab on the same page. They can even choose to remove the link altogether.

### Readability Rating [Flesch Kincaid]
[Link to PR](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc22_seo/pull/8)<br><br>
This feature provides a rating based on the article’s difficulty level. It also highlights where the rating falls in the difficulty range. Rather than simply relying on a rating, the target audience should also be considered before making changes.<br><br>
For instance, an academic article may typically have a lower rating (a significantly high difficulty level for average readers) but the target audience (university grads) won’t find it too difficult to comprehend.

### Paragraph structure
[Link to PR](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc22_seo/pull/5)<br><br>
Having a concise paragraph structure is ideal for SEO and also improves the article's readability especially on smaller screens. Nowadays, people prefer audio/video content over text content. Attention spans are dropping. This makes it crucial for text content creators to capture the reader’s attention. One way to do that is by including crisp and short paragraphs as opposed to long and tedious ones that are difficult to read.<br><br>
Having an ideal paragraph structure improves an article's discoverability on search engines. This feature assists in keeping article paragraphs short and easy to read for viewers. It lists down the top 5 paragraphs that exceed the word limit along with the word count in brackets. Currently the limit for each paragraph has been set to a maximum of 200 words
 
### Sentence Structure
[Link to PR](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc22_seo/pull/6)<br><br>
This works similar to the previous feature with the difference that it works for sentences as opposed to paragraphs.
This feature helps identify the first 5 sentences that are too long to avoid clutter and lists them. The admin can then switch to the Content tab and make the desired changes. Currently the limit for each sentence has been set to a maximum of 20 words
 
### Image Compression
[Link to PR](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc22_seo/pull/14)<br><br>
Images are among the biggest ‘on-page’ factors for a slow loading page. This new feature helps compress large, unoptimized images to improve the page load time.
Currently the proof of concept works for
- The image fields under the Images and Links tab in Article Edit view
- Two formats, 'png' and 'jpeg'

The compression feature is optional (controlled using the enable/disable toggle) and gets triggered when the user saves the article. For a successful compression operation, it also stores a backup of the original image as ```filename_orig```.

The compression feature is optional (controlled using the enable/disable toggle) and gets triggered when the user saves the article. For a successful compression operation, it also stores a backup of the original image as filename_orig.
It provides the user with 3 compression options
- Low Compression - High quality
- Medium Compression - Medium quality
- High Compression - Low quality

### Open Graph
[Link to PR](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc22_seo/pull/9)<br><br>
It gives Joomla content creators the ability to customize their article previews when it’s being shared on social networking sites. It provides users the flexibility to modify each article's open graph data, which in turn can be used by social media platforms to display rich objects. Some of these parameters include
Article Type
Article Title
Article Description
Article Image
Published Date
Article Author


### Social Media Share buttons
[Link to PR](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc22_seo/pull/15)<br><br>
Social media is one of the most popular ways to gain visitors to any website. But currently Joomla doesn't offer any sharing feature.
This feature attempts to bridge that gap by offering options for single-click sharing to the most commonly used social media platforms.<br><br>
Currently this feature allows sharing to only 3 social media platforms. This feature can then be extended to include additional social media icons as required.
Instead of providing a rigid set of options, the Social Media Share tab offers several settings that allows the user to select the preferred list of social media icons to display on the article page. This is done as follows.
- Clicking on show sharebox will display all the available social media platforms for sharing
- The user can then choose to enable social media sharing for the selected list of platforms
- If the user chooses to hide the sharebox options, no social media icon is displayed on the article's frontend
 
These settings can be updated by going to System->Global Configuration->Articles->Social Media Share.

## Joomla Plugins
### 1. Content Analysis Plugin
[Link to Plugin](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc22_seo/tree/content-analysis-plugin)<br><br>
It has five different features combined into one plugin. It highlights the aspects of the article that need improvement and provides suggestions for refinement.<br>
The article's title and meta description are important parameters. These are the first to be noticed by end users when an article shows up on search engines. So it becomes extremely important for the content creator to customize this piece of information as there is limited space available. This plugin helps the Joomla content creator improve these parameters.

<img src="https://github.com/alisha-kamat/GSoC-2022-Work-Report/blob/34f2f1a96adb262b5b4470e8b77e270b0d8de405/images/Content%20Plugin.png">

### 2. Open Graph Plugin
[Link to Plugin](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc22_seo/tree/opengraph)<br><br>
This gives Joomla content creators the ability to customise their article previews when it’s being shared on social networking sites

Here’s how Facebook uses open graph data when an article is shared.

<img src="https://github.com/alisha-kamat/GSoC-2022-Work-Report/blob/34f2f1a96adb262b5b4470e8b77e270b0d8de405/images/Facebook%20OG.png">

After the plugin has been installed and enabled, move to the article's frontend and click on View page source. Here's what it'll show. All the additional open graph data can be seen in the highlighted section (all the meta tags beginning with 'og:' and 'article:').

In the backend, the plugin creates a new tab called Open Graph where the following parameters can be updated.

### 3. Previews Plugin

### 4. Meta Data Plugin
[Link to Plugin](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc22_seo/tree/metadata)<br><br>
It helps customise a page’s metadata so that it’s easier for search engines to determine the relevance of articles before displaying them in search results.

## Future Roadmap
These core features and plugins are still work in progress and they can be enhanced further. 
Since our portfolio of SEO features would be a new addition to Joomla, the idea was to first demonstrate the proof of concept (with a minimum viable product). Based on the feedback from users on what works and what doesn’t, these features can be streamlined and polished.
